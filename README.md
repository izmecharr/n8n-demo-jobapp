# n8n-demo-jobapp
A workflow to help fresh CS grads job hunt in the Philippines. Scrapes company data from Google Maps and logs details into Google Sheets, making it easier to find opportunities beyond LinkedIn, Indeed, or JobStreet.

Problem
As a fresh CS graduate job hunting in the Philippines, I started by checking the usual platforms — LinkedIn, Indeed, and JobStreet. But I realized many opportunities aren’t listed there. A lot of companies can be found through Google Maps, with direct links to their websites and emails where I can apply.

Objectives
1. Scrape company data from Google Maps.
2. Automatically update and organize the results in Google Sheets for easy tracking.
